# Changelog

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Signal format normalization layer in ingestion pipeline — auto-detects legacy format (`signal_id`, `signal_type`, `provenance`) and converts to native format (`id`, `source_skill`, `source_type`)
- Legacy-to-native field mapping with known system name resolution (e.g., `google_workspace` → `ocas-bower`)
- Unknown/extra fields preserved in `_legacy_metadata` — data is never silently discarded
- Audit trail via `_normalized_from` field on converted signals
- Best-effort conversion for unrecognized signal schemas (requires `payload` + timestamp)
- Config toggle: `signal_normalization.enabled` (default: `true`)
- Backlog recovery: `requeue_errors_on_enable` reprocesses previously rejected signals through normalization
- `_normalized_from` and `_legacy_metadata` field notes in schemas

### Fixed
- Resolves 9,009 rejected signals from intake/errors backlog caused by format mismatch between legacy emitters and native schema

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Memory file ingestion (`elephas.ingest.memory`) — extracts entities from MEMORY.md and daily notes during deep consolidation
- Session log ingestion (`elephas.ingest.sessions`) — extracts entities from conversation transcripts, filtering out machine noise (toolResult, compaction, custom entries)
- User relevance model (`user` / `agent_only` / `unknown`) — only user-relevant entities promoted to Chronicle facts
- `user_relevance` field on Signal and Candidate schemas
- `source_type` field on Signal schema (journal / intake / memory / session_log)
- Relevance-related OKRs (relevance_accuracy, agent_only_filter_rate)
- Memory and session ingestion logs for tracking processed files
- Bower recognized as primary Drive artifact signal source

### Changed
- Promotion criteria now requires `user_relevance: "user"` — agent-only entities remain as candidates
- Deep consolidation cron now runs `elephas.ingest.memory && elephas.ingest.sessions && elephas.consolidate.deep`
- All skills now expected to include entity observations in journal payloads
- Filesystem permissions expanded to read Memory/ and session log paths

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `## Ontology types` section per authoring rules v2.4.0
